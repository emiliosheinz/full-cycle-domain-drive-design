  "description": "Domain-Driven Design (DDD) was created by Eric Evans in his book [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.com.br/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215). It is a collection of principles and patterns that help developers craft elegant object systems. It is neither a framework nor a library; instead, it comprises a set of principles and patterns that can be implemented in any software project. It serves as a mindset for approaching software development based on its domain, rather than its technical implementation details.",
