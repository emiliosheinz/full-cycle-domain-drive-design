# Domain Drive Design

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) was created by Eric Evans in his book [Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.com.br/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215). It is a collection of principles and patterns that help developers craft elegant object systems. It is neither a framework nor a library; instead, it comprises a set of principles and patterns that can be implemented in any software project. It serves as a mindset for approaching software development based on its domain, rather than its technical implementation details.

Developers must recognize that software is dynamic, influenced by people in distinct contexts, and advanced techniques are essential for navigating high-complexity scenarios successfully. DDD is vital for complex software projects where traditional off-the-shelf solutions fall short, it becomes specially important when attempting to unravel complex interrelationships within large projects involving numerous stakeholders who may speak different "languages". The complexity in such projects primarily comes from business logic rather than technological challenges and DDD provides a valuable toolkit for developers to have a deep understanding of business domains and enabling effective communication, context separation, and overall clarity in software development.
